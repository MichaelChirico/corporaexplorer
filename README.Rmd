**corpusexplorationr** is an R package for dynamic exploration of text
collections.

<!-- <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> -->

The intended primary audience is qualitatively oriented researchers who
rely on close reading of textual documents as part of their academic activity.

Example use cases include:

* **Datasets that can be freely shared**, e.g. collections of government statements and transcripts scraped from the US State Department or the Russian President's website. Such documents are usually equipped with a Creative Commons license or similar, and making such text collections available in a form better suited for both qualitative and quantitative analysis is in itself a service to the scholarly community.
* **Datasets that cannot be freely shared**. E.g. exploring  a collection of
newspaper articles etc. retrieved from a database.
* **Personal text collections**: any collection of texts that are meaningful to explore with a time aspect.
* **Customised corpora**, e.g. text collections with sentences instead of documents as base unit.

While collecting and preparing the text collections to be explored requires
some R programming knowledge, using the Shiny app(s) for exploring and
extracting documents from the corpus should be rather intuitive also for
someone with no programming knowledge -- when first set up by a collaborator.

Thus, the ambition is that package should be useful for anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of R --
or who knows anyone with this knowledge.


**corpusexplorationr** contains three functions:

1. `prepare_data()` converts a data frame to a corpusexploration object.
2. `run_corpus_explorer()` runs the package's core feature, a Shiny app for fast and flexible
exploration of a corpusexploration object.
3. `run_document_extractor()` runs a Shiny app for simple retrieval/extraction of
documents from a corpusexploration object in a reading-friendly format.

## Installation

To install **corpusexplorationr**, run the following from an R console:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kgjerde/corpusexplorationr")
```


## 1. Prepare data for the Shiny apps

The `prepare_data()` function takes a data frame with, as a minimum, a `Date` and a `Text` column as input
and returns a corpusexploration object that can be explored in the package's two Shiny apps. The default arguments should work fine for most use cases.

After installing **corpusexplorationr**, run the following in the R console
to see full documentation for the `prepare_data()` function.

``` r
library(corpusexplorationr)
?prepare_data
```

## 2. The corpus exploration app
Start the app by running the `run_corpus_explorer()` function with a corpusexploration object created by `prepare_data()` as argument. Run the following in the R console to see documentation for the `run_corpus_explorer()` function.

``` r
library(corpusexplorationr)
?run_corpus_explorer
```

The default arguments are recommended for most use cases.

While it should be possible to use the app without reading any further, the rest of this section includes
user interface instructions as well as some details about the app's inner workings
that are relevant for advanced users.

### 2a. Sidebar input

<img align="left" src="man/figures/sidebar.png" width="170" height="450" style="margin-right: 25px"/>

* **Number of terms to chart**: How many terms (phrases/patterns) should be charted in the corpus map? Current maximum is two.
* **Term(s) to chart**: The corpus map plot will highlight days/documents where these terms are present. The terms will also be highlighted in all documents.
* **Add terms for text highlighting**: Terms included here (one on each line) will be highlighted in all documents. An arbitrary number of terms can be added.
* **Filter corpus?** Input terms here (one on each line) will filter the corpus so that it includes only documents where all these terms are present. Unlike terms entered in the two fields above, these terms will not be included in the summary statistics in the "Corpus info" tab. An arbitrary number of terms can be used.
* **Case sensitive search**: Check this box to distinguish between lower and upper case in the search. Unchecked, `war` will find both "war" and "War"; if checked, `war` will only find "war".
* **"Year range" or "date range"**: Filters the corpus (the first and last date included) by time span.
* **Plot mode ("calendar" or "document wall")**: Should the resulting corpus map treat one day or one document as its base unit?
* **Adjust plot size**: Change plot height. This is the only sidebar input that has effect without clicking the search button.
* **Search button**: Only when search button is clicked will input from the sidebar (with the exception  of the "Adjust plot size" input) be handled by the app.

#### Note: Text input -- regular expressions

All text input will be treated as regular expressions (or *regexes*).
Regular expressions can be very powerful for identifying exactly the
text patterns one is interested in, but this power comes at a high complexity cost.
That said, for simple searches that do not include punctuation, all
one needs to know is basically this:

* `\b` in a search means the beginning or the end of a word.
* `.` in a search means "any single character".

Thus, (in a case insensitive search):
``` r
arctic  # will match both 'Arctic' and 'Antarctic'
\barctic  # will match only 'Arctic'.

civili.ation  # will match both 'civilisation' and 'civilization'
```

For more about regex syntax and the regex flavours available, see the section about regex engines [below](#advanced-detail-regular-expression-engines).

(N.B. As seen in the example, a single backslash (not a double backslash as in the R console)
is used as escape character. For example will `\.` match a literal ".", and `\d` match any digit.)

#### Note: Additional search arguments

**corpusexplorationr** offers two optional arguments that can be used separately or together by adding them to the end of a search pattern (with no space between):

1. The "treshold argument" has the syntax `--treshold` and determines the minimum
number of search hits a document should contain in order to be highlighted in the corpus map:
``` r
Russia--10  # Will find documents that includes the pattern "Russia" at least 10 times.
```

2. The "column argument" has the syntax `--column_name` and allows for searches in other columns than the default full text column:
``` r
Russia--Title  # Will find documents that has the pattern "Russia" in its "Title" column.
```

3. The two arguments can be combined in any order:
``` r
Russia--2--Title
Russia--Title--2
# Will both find documents that includes the pattern "Russia" at least 2 times
# in the Title column.
```

These arguments have the following consequences:

* *If used in the "Term(s) to chart" fields*: The corpus map plot will highlight documents that satisfy the search arguments. Likewise, the summary statistics displayed in the "Corpus info" tab will be based on the documents matching the search arguments. In the document themselves, all pattern matches will be highlighted. For example, a search for `Russia--Title` will highlight only documents with the pattern Russia in the Title column, but the pattern Russia will be highlighted in all documents.
* *If used in the "Add terms for highlighting" field*: The pattern will be highlighted in all documents. The summary statistics displayed in the "Corpus info" tab will be based on the documents matching the search arguments.
* *If used in the "Filter corpus" field*: The corpus will be filtered to include only documents that match the search arguments.

### 2b. Corpus map

The result of the search is an interactive heat map, a **corpus map**, where the colour fill indicates how many times the search term is found (legend above the plot).

In the **calendar view** (the default), each tile represents a day, and the colour fill indicates how many time the search term is found in the documents that day:

```{r, out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/first_search.png")
```

<br>

In the **document wall view**, each tile represents one document, and the colour
fill indicates how many time the search term is found in this document:

```{r, out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/wall_1.png")
```

<br>

The **Corpus info** tab presents some very basic summary statistics of the search results.
(Look at e.g. [`tidytext`](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) and
[`quanteda`](https://github.com/quanteda/quanteda)
for excellent R packages for *quantitative* text analysis. Using such packages
together with **corpusexplorationr** is highly recommended in order to combine qualitative
and quantitative insights.)

Clicking on a tile in the corpus map opens the **document view** to the right of the corpus map.

### 2c. Document view

**When in calendar view**: Clicking on a day creates a second heat map tile chart where one tile is one document,
and where the colour in a tile indicates how many times the search term is found in the document.
In the box below is produced a list of the title of the documents this day.

```{r, out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/day_corpus.png")
```

<br>

Clicking on a "document tile" produces two things. First, the full text of the document with search terms highlighted. Second, above the text a tile chart consisting of n tiles where each tile represents a 1/n part of the document, and where the colour in a tile indicates whether and how many times the search term is found in that part of the document. Clicking on a tile scrolls the document to the corresponding part of the document.

```{r out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/wall.png")
```


**When in document wall view**: Clicking on a tile in the corpus map leads straight to the highlighted document.

### 2d. Advanced detail: Regular expression engines

`run_corpus_exploration()` lets you choose among three regex engine setups:

1. `default`: use the [`re2r`](https://github.com/qinwf/re2r) package for simple searches and the [`stringr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr) package for complex regexes (details below).
This is the recommended option.
2. use `stringr` for all searches.
3. use `re2r`for all searches.  

`re2r` is very fast but allows for less advanced regular expressions than `stringr`
and is more limited when in handling non-ASCII text. With the `default` option,
the `re2r` engine is run when no special regex characters are used;
otherwise the `stringr` engine and syntax is used. This option should fit most use cases.

Please consult the documentation for [`re2r`](https://github.com/qinwf/re2r) and
[`stringr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr) for full information about syntax flavours.

Advanced users can set the `optional_info` parameter in `run_corpus_exploration()` to `TRUE`:
this will print to console the following information for each input term: which regex engine was used,
and whether the search was carried out in the document term matrix or in the full text documents.

## 3. The download documents app

This app is a simple helper app to retrieve a subset of the corpus in a format suitable for close reading.

```{r out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/download_tool.png")
```

Start the app by running the `run_document_extractor()` function with a corpusexploration object created by `prepare_data()` as argument. Run the following in the R console to see documentation for the `run_document_extractor()` function.

``` r
library(corpusexplorationr)
?run_document_extractor
```

### 3a. Sidebar input

* **Term(s) to highlight**: An arbitrary number of search terms (regular expressions)
that will be highlighted in the documents in the produced HTML reports.
* **Filter corpus?**: Input terms here (one on each line) will filter the corpus so that it includes only documents where all these terms are present. Unlike terms entered in the two fields above, these terms will not be included in the summary statistics in the "Corpus info" tab. An arbitrary number of terms can be used.
* **Case sensitive search**: Check this box to distinguish between lower and upper case in the search. Unchecked, `war` will find both "war" and "War"; if checked, `war` will only find "war".
* **"Year range" or "date range"**: Filters the corpus (the first and last date included).

By default, there is an upper limit
of 400 documents to be included in one report (can be changed in the
`max_html_docs` parameter in `run_document_extractor()`).


### 3b. Advanced detail: Regular expression engines

Speed is considered to be of less importance in this app, and all searches
are carried out as full text searches with `stringr`.

Again, note that a single backslash is used as escape character. For example will `\.` match a literal ".", and `\d` match any digit.
